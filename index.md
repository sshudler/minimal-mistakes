I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/). My specialization is
in the broad field of High-Performance Computing (HPC). I also have a strong background in software engineering,
with over 10 years experience in C/C++. In the past, I developed 3D graphics code, wrote CUDA and OpenCL code, and worked on TCP/UDP-based communication protocols.

My research interests focus on exploiting parallelism at extreme-scale. Specifically, I'm interested in four aspects of this problem: (i) performance analysis and modeling; (ii) parallel programming paradigms and algorithms; (iii) scalability of HPC applications; and (iv) visualization of analysis data.
