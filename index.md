I am a computer researcher / PhD candidate in the [Laboratory for Parallel Programming]
(https://www.parallel.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/team/sergei-shudler/) at [Technical
University of Darmstadt](https://www.parallel.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/informatik/).

My research interests focus on exploiting parallelism at extreme-scale. Specifically, I am interested in four aspects of this problem: (i) performance analysis and modeling; (ii) parallel programming paradigms and algorithms; (iii) HPC applications; and (iv) visualization of analysis data.
