I have 10+ years of software development experience. In the past, I developed 3D graphics code, wrote CUDA and OpenCL code, and worked on TCP/UDP-based communication protocols. Some time ago I decided to go back to research and get a PhD. Currently, I'm senior researcher in the field of High-Performance Computing (HPC) in the [Laboratory for Parallel Programming](https://www.parallel.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/team/sergei-shudler/) at [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.parallel.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/informatik/).

My research interests focus on exploiting parallelism at extreme-scale. Specifically, I'm interested in four aspects of this problem: (i) performance analysis and modeling; (ii) parallel programming paradigms and algorithms; (iii) scalability of HPC applications; and (iv) visualization of analysis data.
