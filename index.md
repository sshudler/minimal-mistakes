I specialize in high-performance computing (HPC), parallel programming, and C++. In the course of my work, I used techniques from machine learning (linear regression) to uncover performance bottlenecks and develop a framework to engineer parallel applications for better scalability. Also, I have a strong background in software engineering with rich experience in C/C++, STL, multithreading, Python, OpenGL, and OpenCL.
