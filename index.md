I am an applied researcher in high-performance computing (HPC). My current work at CASC in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory focuses on tools and workflows that target scalability bottlenecks in simulation applications, both from performance and data processing aspects. Languages and APIs I actively use: C/C++, Python, MPI, OpenMP, CUDA.
